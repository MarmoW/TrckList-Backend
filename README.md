# Trck-List: API for Managing Task Lists and Notes

[ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· Leia este README em portuguÃªs](README.pt-BR.md)

## Description

**Trck-List** is an API built with **Node.js** and **Prisma ORM** that allows users to create and manage task lists and notes. Task lists can be shared via a code (either single-use or multi-use), making it easy to divide tasks among multiple people. Additionally, notes can be shared via a generated link. The API includes user registration, authentication, and password recovery features.

## Features

* **User Registration and Authentication:** Secure account creation and login.
* **List Management:** Create, edit, delete, and share task lists and notes (only task lists can be shared).
* **Note Sharing:** Create, manage, and share notes through a unique link.
